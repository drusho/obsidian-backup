## Zettelkasten Method
<p>
<i>The Zettelkasten Method is a note-taking and knowledge management system popularized by German sociologist Niklas Luhmann. It involves creating individual notes on paper slips or cards, linking them together through subject headings or metadata, and organizing them in a way that facilitates connections between ideas for improved memory retention and knowledge building.</i>
