## What is a Data Pipeline?
<span style="background:#fff88f">The data pipeline is a set of functions, tools, and techniques to process raw data</span>. Pipes include a number of related processes to link the series, which allow the transmission of data from its source to the destination for storage and analysis. Once the data has been imported, it is taken for each of these steps, in **which** the single-step output results next step input.

In modern technology, extensive data applications rely on a microservice-based model, allowing loads of monolithic functions to be divided into modular sections with more minor codes. This promotes data flow across multiple systems, with data generated by one service into one or more service inputs (applications). In addition, a well-designed data pipeline helps to manage the variability, volume, and speed of data in these applications.

A data pipeline is a set of tools and processes for collecting, processing, and delivering data from one or more sources to a destination where it can be analyzed and used. Nowadays in the 21st generation, we must cope with each and every piece of information or data we get. When we usually hear about pipelines, we suddenly think about those natural gas and oil pipelines that carry those resources from one location to another over long distances. But here we are going to know about the data pipelines.
